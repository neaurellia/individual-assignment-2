1. First, I figured out to combine Tutorial 0 and 1 for this assignment, then after comparing the checklist and the tutorial, I simply followed the tutorials with the checklist as my guideline and made changes where necessary. I created a new repository for the new project and many folders and files inside folders as shown in the checklist, I then performed routing and created a model. I had to adjust here and for the function in views.py as well. I then created a routing in urls.py for the application main to map the function created in views.py then deployed to PWS.

   urls.py -> maps URLs to specific views (which view should handle that request)
   views.py -> contains the logic to execute request, communicates with models.py to fetch or update data from database, if necessary, it will pass data to HTML template for rendering
   models.py -> defines models (data structure), interacts with database
   HTML file -> view passes data to HTML file, dynamically generates a webpage using the provided data, and this page is then returned to the client as a response

4. Git can track changes made. Git keeps track of changes made so that developers can review or go back to the previous code when needed. Git can allow developers to collaborate as it allows merging without conflict and also branch so that if anything happens to one branch, the others will not be affected. Git can also back up data.
   
5. I find it seamless that it uses chunks of python and HTML so that we can learn something new and strengthen previous knowledge as well. Despite many new things to learn, I did not struggle as much as I had been familiar with Python.
  
6. It allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects rather than writing raw SQL queries. This way, it reduces errors in database interactions.
